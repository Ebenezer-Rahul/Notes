* Hyperlog log
** problem 
   Have a good Estimate of number of unique elements in a list 
   whithout having O(n) space for a map.
   do it in O(1) memory (may be in O(loglogn)
** idea
   given a random binary number 
   the probabilty that the number starts with k zeros is pow(2,k)
   Now this also means that in a given sample if we have tracked the max number of starting zero's to be say k
   we can estimate that there are pow(2, k) unique elements in the sample.
   but 
   - we need to map some arbitary entry i.e struct into a binary number 
   - also make sure that it behaves as if as a random mapping to binary number 
   - also make sure that the same elements should be mapped to the same binary numbers 
   This can be achived by a hash function.
   But our estimate is not good with just the following so we make it good by diving the whole into parts and use
   some statistics to get a better estimate
